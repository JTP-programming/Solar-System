    <h2>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
        It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.
        It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.
